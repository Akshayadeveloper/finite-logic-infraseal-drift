<b>FINITE LOGIC: InfraSeal - Configuration Drift Preventer</b>

InfraSeal uses a state reconciliation engine to detect and evaluate configuration drift between the declared (IaC) state and the live infrastructure state. It goes beyond simple comparison by calculating a Drift Severity Score to recommend the safest action (forward-apply, rollback, or manual intervention).

<b>Solved Problem: </b>

Prevents "snowflake" servers and silent infrastructure degradation. By prioritizing automated correction based on risk, it eliminates the majority of manual maintenance tasks related to configuration mismatches, improving system stability and compliance.
